TextToDocx
==========

### This is nowhere near complete, I don't even think it works. I'm using [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) instead.

Converts a text file to a .docx Word document.

I'm going to be using this for [school](https://github.com/anubiann00b/school), converting Markdown files into printable word documents.
